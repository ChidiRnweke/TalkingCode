# Overview

> **Question** 🧑🏿‍💻: What is the purpose of this project? 


> **chatGITpt** 🤖: As a machine learning engineer and web developer, my GitHub repositories showcase my academic and personal projects, highlighting my skills in areas such as web development, machine learning, and data science. While my very advanced projects are not open-source, the repositories available offer a glimpse into my coding capabilities and project involvement. 


## ... RAG what?

chatGITpt is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) chatbot that has access to all of my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ChidiRnweke). In case you're unfamiliar with RAG chatbots, the basic idea is that you summarize each of the code files in your repository into one or more lists of numbers, also known as embeddings. When a user sends a message to the chatbot, the message is also summarized into an embedding. These embeddings are then compared to find the most similar embeddings. The original code files are then appended to the original question as additional context. The chatbot then generates a response based on the context. The response is generated using a language model. The chatbot is able to generate responses that are relevant to the user's message.
