    "response": "<section><h3>Testing Strategy</h3><p>In my projects, I employ a combination of unit and integration tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code. Below is an overview of my testing strategy:</p><section><h4>Unit Tests</h4><p>Unit tests are focused on individual components or functions. They are faster and easier to write because they do not depend on external systems. Here is an outline of the unit test strategy used in the <code>TicTacToeTests.scala</code> file:</p><pre><code>import munit._\n import Tictactoe.*\n class TicTacToeTests extends FunSuite: \n test(\"Row is complete with identical tiles\")\n { ... }\n test(\"Board is full with all tiles occupied\") \n{ ... }\n test(\"Winning with a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right\") \n{ ... } \n// Additional test cases...</code></pre><p>These tests focus on different scenarios like checking the completion and fullness of rows, handling moves, and determining game outcomes.</p></section><section><h4>Integration Tests</h4><p>Integration tests assess how different components of the system interact with each other. They are more complex and generally slower than unit tests because they often involve a database or other external systems. In the backend, these tests are run directly on the backend code instead of through the API, as described in <code>docs/backend/testing.md</code>:</p><pre><code># Testing The testing strategy of the backend is using a combination of unit and integration tests. ... ## Integration tests Integration tests actually capture a lot of the complexity of the backend. ... ...</code></pre><p>In these tests, <code>Testcontainers</code> is used to spin up a PostgreSQL database, and the interactions between different backend services are tested.</p></section><section><h4>Example in TypeScript</h4><p>For the frontend, I've used Vitest to test various functionalities of components. Here's an example from <code>src/index.test.ts</code> that tests a dark-mode toggle component:</p><pre><code>import { describe, beforeEach, afterEach, test, expect, vi } from \"vitest\"; describe(\"DarkModeToggle Component\", () =&gt; { beforeEach(() =&gt; { ... }); afterEach(() =&gt; { ... }); test(\"initializes dark mode based on system preference\", () =&gt; { ... }); test(\"toggles dark mode on click\", () =&gt; { ... }); test(\"initializes dark mode based on localStorage preference\", () =&gt; { ... }); });</code></pre><p>These tests check the initialization and toggling of dark mode, based on user interaction and system preferences.</p></section></section><section id=\"sources\">To answer this question, I used the following sources:<ul><li>testing.md in chatGITpt, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChidiRnweke/chatGITpt/main/docs/backend/testing.md\">source.</a></li><li>TicTacToeTests.scala in scala-tictactoe, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChidiRnweke/scala-tictactoe/main/shared/src/test/scala/TicTacToeTests.scala\">source.</a></li><li>index.test.ts in chatGITpt, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChidiRnweke/chatGITpt/main/frontend/src/index.test.ts\">source.</a></li><li>index.test.ts in chatGITpt, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChidiRnweke/chatGITpt/main/frontend/src/index.test.ts\">source.</a></li><li>index.test.ts in DarkModeToggleComponent, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChidiRnweke/DarkModeToggleComponent/main/src/index.test.ts\">source.</a></li></ul></section>",
